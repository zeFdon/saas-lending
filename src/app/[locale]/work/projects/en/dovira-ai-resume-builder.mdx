## Overview

I built this project from scratch, managing both the front-end and back-end, and integrating AI specifically to optimize resumes. The platform helps users quickly customize their resumes for specific job listings by analyzing job descriptions and matching key skills. I developed AI-driven features to generate targeted bullet points and enhance keyword relevance, making each resume better suited to the role. With an easy-to-use interface and a job application tracker, users can keep everything organized and boost their chances of standing out—all without the usual resume-editing hassle.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Resume Optimization**: Automatically tailors resumes to match specific job descriptions by analyzing key skills and requirements, making each application more targeted and impactful.
- **Auto-Generated Bullet Points**: Generate job-specific bullet points based on essential skills, helping users quickly create focused, professional summaries for each role.
- **Keyword Matching for Better Visibility**: Ensures resumes include relevant keywords to boost compatibility with job listings, increasing chances of being noticed by recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS).
- **Application Tracking Dashboard**: Keep all job applications in one organized place with easy status updates. Track every step, from application submission to interview, for a clear view of job search progress.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End
- **React**: Built a responsive and dynamic user interface, enabling seamless interaction and quick updates for users.
- **Zustand**: Utilized for state management to keep the application simple, efficient, and performant, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Back-End
- **FastAPI**: Created a high-performance, asynchronous API backend to handle business logic, manage requests, and streamline data processing.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database to store and manage user data, job applications, and resume details, ensuring reliability and scalability.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **DigitalOcean**: Deployed the application and database on DigitalOcean for secure, scalable cloud hosting and simplified deployment.

### Machine Learning Agent
- **LangChain**: Integrated LangChain to power advanced AI capabilities, like analyzing job descriptions and generating tailored resume content, making the application smarter and more adaptive.

This stack combines a modern front-end, a robust and high-speed back-end, a scalable cloud infrastructure, and powerful AI capabilities, creating an optimized experience for users as they streamline their job applications.
